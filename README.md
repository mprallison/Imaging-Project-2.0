Tidied scripts from results of QuPath cell detection.HDBSCAN offers very promising clustering results for RGB channel values with out of the box hyper parameters. Functions provide easy filtering of results by cluster, channel limits and x,y coordinates. 
Results can be visualised as stacked bar of cell channel ratio, masked image or empty matrix displaying cells as RGB block.
